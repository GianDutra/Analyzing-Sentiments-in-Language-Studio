## About the project

Using Language Studio, I created a review of a fictional hotel in Tokyo, as if I were a guest who stayed there. Finally, the language analysis in Azure evaluates the sentences contained in my comment and displays the results in percentages, categorizing them as positive, neutral, or negative.
  
## **Analyze sentiment and mine opinions**

## Final Considerations
I was amazed when I discovered that sentiment analysis existed and was so easily accessible within Language Studio. Without a doubt, it's a powerful tool that could be utilized, for example, by a hotel chain to gather insights from customer feedback. With a deeper analysis of the data, they could then improve their services.
