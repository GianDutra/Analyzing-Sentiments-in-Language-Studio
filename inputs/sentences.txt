Horrible Experience at Tokyo Paradise

Tokyo Paradise, Tokyo, Japan

Terrible experience at Tokyo Paradise! The reception staff was rude and unwelcoming. When I requested an extra pillow, I was informed of unexpected additional charges. The Wi-Fi connection was so slow it was practically unusable. Not worth the price at all.
